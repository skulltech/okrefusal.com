title: Best Beginner Budget Guitar Amps in 2019, According to the Internet 

---


In this same spirit of [this post](/articles/best-beginner-electric-guitars) about the best electric guitars, I decided to make another list about... drum roll...  best beginner guitar amps! Because what's a good electric guitar without a decent amp to bring teh tone?

Like always, Google generously supplied the opinions of the Interweb. This one was a little trickier than doing the same with guitars, because there were such a large number of amps to choose from, and there was little agreement between websites about what's the best amp! So, I had to embark deep into the third page of Google search, who does that?! So here it is, the list I got upon compiling books from the first three pages of Google search results of the query “beginner budget electric guitar amp”.

- __Important__ — Number of ★s against an amp indicates the number of times that amp came up repeating, so the more the better.

# Top picks: Compiled list

There are a lot of diversity and no definite trend in the list with the exact amp models, so that isn't really helpful. So, I decided to make another derivative list, in which I counted amp models from the same series as one. Usually, the main difference they had was in the power rating. I figured once you know what are the best amp series, you could choose the exact model depending upon your budget and how loud you want it to be. Also, I left out models // series which appeared only once.
