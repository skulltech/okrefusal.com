title: Best Beginner Budget Electric Guitars in 2019, According to the Internet
---

**Update** — I wrote a similar post about best beginner budget guitar amps, you can find it [here](/articles/best-beginner-guitar-amps).

I've been dabbling in music for a few months now, mostly playing an acoustic guitar borrowed from a friend. But the primary reason for my attraction to guitar was lead solos, especially the ones by David Gilmour. So I decided to “upgrade” and buy an electric guitar. But then there was this inevitable dilemma of selection, which one should I buy? You should note that I was looking for beginner _budget_ guitars, not expensive ones.

Naturally, Google came to help. Upon compiling books from the first two pages of Google search results of the query “beginner budget electric guitar”, what I got is the list below. FYI, I've made a similar post before, about books every startup founder should read, you can find that [here](/articles/books-every-startup-founder-should-read).

- **Important** — Number of ★s against a guitar indicates the number of times that guitar came up repeating, so the more the better.
